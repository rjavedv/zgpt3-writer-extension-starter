### Welcome ðŸ‘‹
This extension has been built with a lot of guidence from "buildspace". As of now this extension allows you to select some text on any web page and from the context menu choose 'Explain with GPT'. It will open a new tab and displays your selected text along with output from GPT3.
I am leaving the following lines as it is since this was forked from the following links.

This is the starter template for the [build your own AI writing assistant w/ GPT-3](https://buildspace.so/builds/ai-writer) project. 

### **Questions?**
Have some questions make sure you head over to your [buildspace Dashboard](https://buildspace.so/p/build-ai-writing-assistant-gpt3) and link your Discord account so you can get access to helpful channels and your instructor!
